# Bit Arrays in Haskell
Learned about bit arrays in my uni Computer Science course and figured I'd help solidify the knowledge by implementing this in Haskell.

This is mostly for experimentation, so nothing crazy. Expect some inconsistency and weird code.

## API
Contains 4 functions (so far):
1. `generateBitArray seq set`
2. `boolToBit bool`
3. `isBitSubset b1 b2`
4. `isSubsetOf x y`
